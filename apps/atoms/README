1. Run 'python atoms.py' to generate 'atoms.json' and the batch script 'run.x' from 'atoms.in'

2. Run './atom' to generate json input file for a specific atom

3. Run batch script './run.x' to generate default json input file for all atoms. Optionally, redirect the
   stderr stream to a file ('./run.x 2> err.dat') to save the absolute total energy error with respect to the NIST data.    
   WARNING! NIST total energy is computed with Vosko-Wilk-Nusair correlation energy (available from LibXC as XC_LDA_C_VWN).
